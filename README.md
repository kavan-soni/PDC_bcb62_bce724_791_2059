Data Analysis using Hadoop and Python
This paper provides an outline of Hadoop highlighting the importance of parallel computing. The Hadoop is enabled by the current advancements in areas of data analytics. This document explains about how we can find the count of a specific word in a document. Using this application, we can solve a plentiful amount of problems out of which a handful of them are listed in this document and a common approach to solve most of them is mentioned in proposed method. Also, this paper shows and clarifies different comparative Python empowered calculations which are utilized with different sorts of conventions and subsequent to examining every one of the strategies specified here has a proposed approach which is clarified why it is more helpful over every other technique. This paper goes on to explain the method of developing a Mapreduce program in Java which gives us the word count of a particular word in a document and thus Parallel computing.
